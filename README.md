# Ionic-v3-Firebase-Shopping-Cart

Simple demonstration of Ionic V3 Shopping Cart using Firebase Auth and Firebase DB to store users' carts and also Firebase storage to store item images.
Note that this project is still in development. 

I used [Ionic v2 Conferance App](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-conference-app) for template. 

## Getting Started

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mg52/Ionic-v3-Firebase-Shopping-Cart
$ cd Ionic-v3-Firebase-Shopping-Cart
$ npm install
$ ionic serve
```
